So, actually wordpress was blocked for a long time. I have never visit wordpress for THREE years!Â Although I could jailbreak the [Chinese Great Firewall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project "What"), I do not update this blog any more in last three years.

Just come back and leave some update. and might some useful skill article.

During these three year, I focus on start my own business and pull all my time into learn more in work. At the same time, I get married with Sherry and lucky have a baby this year. Being a father is really a different feeling for me.

Thanks to [Shadowsocks](http://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html "A anonymous sock5 proxy") let me back to the real international rather than staying in intranet in China.
