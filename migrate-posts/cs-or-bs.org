## What I am talking about?
At beginning of software development, client side  becoming popular in OS. So you have to install everything with a .EXE on window or .APP on Mac. Until now, we have a lot of C/S application in our personal computer.

##C/S is more popular
From 90s, C/S are more popular in computers. Every application has an installer or a local executable file. If you would like to run a application, you have to install it first which usually in Windows, or copy an executable file to Mac.

When internet hit all the world, another kind of application start to change the world, It's browser.

##B/S is more popular
Before iPhone appear, B/S are more competitive than C/S. When Google make the biggest joke on April 1st about Gmail. Google seems prefer B/S much more than C/S. Google Map, Google Mail, Google doc. Google wave etc.

##C/S with B/S.
I could say iPhone save C/S and draw C/S back to our sight. iOS app should be define as C/S absolutely. More developer seems to be attract by amazing app.

At the same time, API are becoming more important if any app want to be universal for all platform. You have to at least use B/S to build your API server.

##My opinion.
C/S does more fluency on Client and B/S does more conveniency. With more speed of our network, I do think B/S will more popular than C/S in next decade. For application in business, user would not like upgrade their client application. Or they could not keep all their users up to date. But if user using B/S in their business, they won't worry about this.

This is what  Google doing now. all google service are something kind of B/S application.
