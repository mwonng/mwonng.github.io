It's time to move from **Ruby on Rails** to **React.js** for my Blog.

After tried a lot of React option, including using Node with Medium, React, Next.js, Gatsby.js etc. I do finally choose Gatsby.js as blog choose. It's look the same with Jekyll in Ruby world. I might explain a little bit more for this choice.

But anyway. Its a good start since last time after Medium do not allow me to bind my domain.

I have to say I do love React with GraphQL.
