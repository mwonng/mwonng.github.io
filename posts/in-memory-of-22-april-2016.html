<p>
Today must be the most important day in my life.
</p>

<p>
I want to thank a lot of person who give me huge help. Within almost one year, I just finally get the right direction of my nomination.
</p>

<p>
Lawyer call me directly before sending the official confirmation. It must be also a big surprise for him. Even some days before, I do still doubt if my nomination will be issue and i start to consider other solution for my family. When this comes true, especially before my birthday, It really a big gift for me and my family.
</p>

<p>
Yes, It sounds like it's not a big thing and it was just approved according the law. There is no one know how sad it suffers me and my wife even my lovely daughter. No one knows what happened to me in past last year.
</p>

<p>
I am very appreciate all my friends who still support me all the time.
