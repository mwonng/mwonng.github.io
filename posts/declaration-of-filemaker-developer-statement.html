I am honor to being the first certificated FileMaker Business Alliance(FBA) partner in China area. With my 10 years FileMaker experience and my friends in Apple and FileMaker, I’m very shame to say i did a lot support to FileMaker and I will never to say that in the future. I am very appreciate for Jeff Cui(Current BDM in FileMaker China), Mr. Gui(current in Apple), Mr. Duanmu(was in Apple).

<p>
I was <b>NEVER</b> and will NEVER mention my FBA qualification in any community or group.
</p>

<p>
I have <b>NEVER</b> shows up in any community or IRC about FileMaker since 2014. I am very happy to help new FileMaker developer to know about how it runs properly and it obviously free to all developers. I was mentioned disadvantage for all developer i have meet in FileMaker.
</p>

<p>
Before 2014, there is no ever group or community help me to improve or decorate our development and i was NEVER grow up in any group. Compare this, it’s rather than to say i was helping a lot developer in some communities. I have to declare that I have nothing with any group or community.
</p>

<p>
I also have to declare that I was been kicked out from the community which mentioned i was trained there, some as <b>紅星(Mr. Zhang) and *三爺(owner of *神機妙算</b>).
</p>

<p>
I’m very shame to say i did a lot support to FileMaker and I will never to say that in the future.
