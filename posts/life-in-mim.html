After i get the interview from Adam and Brett, I did a search about MIM's website and it's business. To my suprise, MIM sells products by weekly and it will pay 12 months. As a chinese, i calcuated immediately with 52 times by it's weekly price.

<i>Make it Mine is a online rental service locate in eastern suburb of Melbourne.</i>

<p>
<b>I'm very apprecaite that MIM (Make It Mine) gave me the opportunity working here and in memory of my MIM life.</b>

<p>
What the ***k, the total price actually 1.5 times or even more than its retail price. To be honest, be a chinese, i do really full of question mark of my brain. I even cant't believe how this business operated. So it's totally a new kind of business into my experience.
</p>

<p>
After working for a while, i can understand MIM always forcus on those people who cannot afford the retail price of product and the true is, there is a great number of residents is our potential customers. I promise this kind of business won't able to stand in Chinese marketing more than 1 months and i believe most of Chinese did not ever hear about MIM. (lol, as i think if any chinese cannot afford the full price of the product, they will not buy it at all except property, you can't image a chinese would like to pay installment with total amount more than retail price a a lot)

The good is it is realy a humanistic-helpful company. Free lunch and soft drink, casual Friday afternoon. Manager are well educated and respect you and easy to talk. Flexiability about work hours, work from home and your leave.

<p>
The bad is the techology are still very old and not open source very well. Java/.Net package are more welcome than other open source project which i supposed MIM would be contribute to the community.

<h2 id="org5248b88">Role and daily work</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5248b88">
<p>
My role is <span class="underline">Website Frontend Developer/Programmer</span> and my daily are all concern about UI change. But later, I actaully have to become a PHP full stack developer in the last few months.
</p>

<p>
Main work actually is coding carousel banner/popup banner/category banner for every campaign. Later i found it totally repeatable so i did a script by node Cli and also available in npm which will generate templates files. Later, i trying to set up all variables to the top of templates area so that i can update anytime after using script, but this been declined by the reason is variable should not only use once.
</p>

<p>
Some other UI change is not very friendly in MVC specially in PHP, so i use React to create some component that can be reuse it anytime in my off time.
</p>

<p>
I can't tell more here about detail of my daily work, mainly with php temlates and css, javascript and Html5. I was trying to bring react component but team do not very happy to have it involved.
