<h1 class="title">C/S or B/S?</h1>
<div class="PREVIEW">
<p>
At beginning of software development, client side  becoming popular in OS. So you have to install everything with a .EXE on window or .APP on Mac. Until now, we have a lot of C/S application in our personal computer.

<h2 id="org9839fbe">C/S is more popular</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9839fbe">
<p>
From 90s, C/S are more popular in computers. Every application has an installer or a local executable file. If you would like to run a application, you have to install it first which usually in Windows, or copy an executable file to Mac.
</p>

<p>
When internet hit all the world, another kind of application start to change the world, It's browser.

<div id="outline-container-org600e99d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org600e99d">B/S is more popular</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org600e99d">
<p>
Before iPhone appear, B/S are more competitive than C/S. When Google make the biggest joke on April 1st about Gmail. Google seems prefer B/S much more than C/S. Google Map, Google Mail, Google doc. Google wave etc.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org435a9a2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org435a9a2">C/S with B/S.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org435a9a2">
<p>
I could say iPhone save C/S and draw C/S back to our sight. iOS app should be define as C/S absolutely. More developer seems to be attract by amazing app.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, API are becoming more important if any app want to be universal for all platform. You have to at least use B/S to build your API server.

<h2 id="orgdbcd030">My opinion.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdbcd030">
<p>
C/S does more fluency on Client and B/S does more conveniency. With more speed of our network, I do think B/S will more popular than C/S in next decade. For application in business, user would not like upgrade their client application. Or they could not keep all their users up to date. But if user using B/S in their business, they won't worry about this.
</p>

<p>
This is what  Google doing now. all google service are something kind of B/S application.
